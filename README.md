# Overview about Learn Data Science project

Hi, I am Ngan Thai. This is my first project about data science. 

As a beginner, I learn data science by practicing in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build some simple models based on basics algorithms, such as: Linear Regression, Logistics Regression and Random Forest to solve problems of prediction and classification. By the way, I am still reinforcing my knowledge day by day to be more flexible in processing, interpreting and analysing data to give useful insights.

# My techniques used within these datasets

To fully view my work in each dataset, please go to the coresponding folder.

## Dataset 1: Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist
*Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce
Exploratory data analysis
Using Python to extract information from the 'customer side' and visualize data:
-	Cleaning, transforming, visualizing data to explore insights about customers’ decisions on the platform.
-	Finally, analyzing how different factors influence purchasing decisions.

## Dataset 2: Prediction on Houses’ prices
*Dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiwari91/Housing-Prices/master/train.csv
-	Doing basic exploratory data analysis on raw data using Python.
-	Using Random Forest (Regressor) to calculate feature importance to do feature selection for the model.                                                                           
-	Using Linear Regression algorithm to predict houses’ prices.

## Dataset 3:Churn detection
*Dataset: https://github.com/pnhuy/datasets/raw/master/Churn.xls
-	Using Random Forest (Classifier) to calculate feature importance to do feature selection for the model.
-	Then, predict whether a user will leave the platform using Logistics Regression and Random Forest.
-	Finally, evaluate and compare the efficiency between the two algorithms.
